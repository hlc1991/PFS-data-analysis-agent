"""Automatic cleanup of runtime artifacts (uploads/ and outputs/).

Why this exists
---------------
Without TTL pruning, `uploads/` grows unbounded with every uploaded
spreadsheet (users routinely upload 50+ MB Excel files), and
`outputs/charts/` collects an HTML file per chart generation.
Disk pressure aside, these directories also accumulate sensitive
user data (PII in source data, embedded credentials in chart titles, etc.).

Policy
------
Each rule is `(directory, max_age_days)`. A file older than `max_age_days`
(by mtime) is deleted on the next sweep. Sub-directories are walked.
Empty leaf directories are pruned after their files are.

Defaults are conservative — they keep enough history for normal workflows
(re-opening last week's analysis works fine) while bounding worst-case growth.

Overrides
---------
Set environment variables before `setup_cleanup` runs:
    PFS_CLEANUP_UPLOAD_DAYS=14   # default 30
    PFS_CLEANUP_OUTPUT_DAYS=30   # default 90
    PFS_CLEANUP_DISABLED=1       # skip cleanup entirely (e.g. dev work)
    PFS_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS=6 # default 24

Threading
---------
A daemon thread sleeps `interval_hours` between sweeps. It dies with the
process; no shutdown signal needed. The very first sweep runs synchronously
during `setup_cleanup()` so anything stale at boot disappears immediately.
